# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Benjamin M.

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on __December 31<sup>st</sup>, Saturday, 2022__.

## Log

### R1D1 
The start of another attempt to record each day as I program, I will also try to update my obsidian programming log every couple of days with what has been done on said day.
The main plain of today was to complete a CRUD system for a photography portfolio images which I have been able to complete in regards to just the images.
My next task is to create a CRUD system for the collection and category of images to make it easy to add new collections and category for new images.
All part of the new version of [Aspen Turner Photography website](https://actphotos.net) which will be using the Next.js framework to help optimise the entire website for user usage

### R1D2

On this day, I added the CRUD system for portfolio categories and collections to the new version of [Aspen Turner Photography website](https://actphotos.net).
I can now move on to the store side of the backend api where a lot of the end points will mostly be.

I also started to create some github actions to automate the ci/cd process

### R1D3

Today I was able to complete both the Store photos and products CRUD system for the ActPhotos api. The next few days on this product are just going to be adding the other models of the product to the CRUD system and testing if they work correctly

I also returned to an old project of mine on this day, Sancus (Discord.NET) and added some error handling for missing permissions.
This gave me the idea to look into the docker image/container system to see if this could be useful for my project. After a few hours of trying to understand docker, I decided to implement it into my Bot and to The ActPhotos api to allow for easy updating and managing of the projects

### R1D4

I took a day off yesterday from this challenge while I focus on some other personal stuff but today I started coding my own portfolio/tool site where I plan to include things like general tools or api information for different things like image resizing or similar. Also this is where my blog about developing will be placed. Additionally, I got offered to work on some offered some additional work to create some stuff for a friend of mine today. So started to have a look into that as well.

### R1D5

Today I started with to begin working on a new project for my friend, which is just like a Minecraft plugin/s which will be part of my primary focus but also not super time sensative to get it done any time soon. Which will be first time actually creating a proper Minecraft plugin from scratch. I already have got the plugin loading onto a server with a basic help command showing.

### R1D6

Quite alot of my effort on this day was spent trying to figure where to start with creating the plugin for my friend. But I figured out to just start with trying to sort out the basic game functionailty like knowing who all the players are and knowing if they are dead or alive. My current plan is to spend another day or two on this project then switch back to Aspen Turner Photography for a couple days while I am at university for a week. Then I will return to this project.
