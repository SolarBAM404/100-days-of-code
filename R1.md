The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on ___January 1<sup>st</sup>, Sunday, 2023__.

## Log

### R1D1 
The start of another attempt to record each day as I program, I will also try to update my obsidian programming log every couple of days with what has been done on said day.
The main plain of today was to complete a CRUD system for a photography portfolio images which I have been able to complete in regards to just the images.
My next task is to create a CRUD system for the collection and category of images to make it easy to add new collections and category for new images.
All part of the new version of [Aspen Turner Photography website](https://actphotos.net) which will be using the Next.js framework to help optimise the entire website for user usage

### R1D2

On this day, I added the CRUD system for portfolio categories and collections to the new version of [Aspen Turner Photography website](https://actphotos.net).
I can now move on to the store side of the backend api where a lot of the end points will mostly be.

I also started to create some github actions to automate the ci/cd process
